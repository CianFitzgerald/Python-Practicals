By using different values for the index we can see that each value has an associated letter from the string “elephant” based on its position in the string. For instance if we set the value of the index to 0 and print the associated letter, the program returns the letter ”e”. Similarly if we set the value of the index to 1 and print the associated letter, the program returns the letter “l”, and so on and so forth up until the value 7. After the value 7 the program will not access any character as it is outside the length of the string.
