a) When x and y are the same value, the slice length is 0 and therefore there is no output, we receive output "Segment is".b) When x is greater than y there is no output as the slice length is calculated by subtracting x from y, therefore if x is greater than y the program cannot produce a negatively valued substring. we receive output "Segment is".c) When x is omitted its index defaults to a value of 0 i.e. the first character of the string. For example if x is omitted and y is 4 we receive output "Segment is herd"d) When y is omitted its index defaults to the value of the number of characters in the string in question. In this instance that value is 15, and therefore if y is omitted and x is for example 1, we receive output "Segment is erd of animals"e) As above, if both indices x and y are omitted then x is 0 and y is 15.  Therefore a segment is produced from the first character of the string up to the final character, in this case the sub string and the string are the same.
