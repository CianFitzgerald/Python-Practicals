Q2.The non-recursive function does not report an error, however the processing time increases significantly passed the 200,000 mark, with a wait time of around 20-30 seconds. As well as this you are met with a wall of text for the output as the number is so large. I attempted to calculate the factorial of 1,000,000 but was waiting over 5 minutes without any output. The recursive function on the other hand reaches a maximum recursion depth error at an input of exactly 2958. Therefore we can see that the non-recursive function allows for far greater inputs.
